# Brain Tumor Segmentation using Deep Learning

This project is based on my Master's dissertation titled
"Brain Tumor Diagnosis using Optimized Segmentation Techniques".

The goal of this project is to automatically segment brain tumors
from MRI images using deep learning models.

## What this project does
- Takes MRI brain scans as input
- Uses deep learning models to detect tumor regions
- Compares multiple segmentation models

## Models used
- U-Net
- nnU-Net
- UNETR
- Hybrid CNN–Transformer model

## Dataset
BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) dataset  
The dataset is not included due to usage restrictions.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- PyTorch
- MONAI
- NumPy
